## The tern navigation file is the only transformed dataset

The response variable analysed by Wynn et al. (2025), instantaneous deflection from the goal, is not in the
archived file, which contains raw geolocator positions. It is computed here as:

1. each track is split into autumn and spring migration using the departure and arrival dates already in the file;
2. the goal is the individual's mean position between arrival at and departure from the wintering area (autumn)
   or the breeding colony at 53.5111 N, 8.1056 E (spring);
3. deflection is the absolute angle between the bearing to the next fix and the bearing to the goal;
4. steps shorter than 100 km are dropped, following the paper's stopover filter.

This keeps 2,689 fixes from 186 tracks and 78 of the 102 birds; tracks without wintering dates cannot be
classified and are lost. The published estimates are an among-individual effect of -0.870 degrees per year and
a within-individual effect of +0.851; this derivation gives -0.769 and +0.903. The sign pattern is unchanged at
50 km (-0.66 / +1.24) and 200 km (-0.55 / +1.58) thresholds, but disappears with no distance filter
(-0.06 / +3.61), so the stopover filter matters, exactly as the paper states.

`sex_raw` preserves the original coding. `sex` harmonises the numeric codes to letters: nineteen individuals
appear under both codings, and code 1 always coincides with m (nine individuals) and 2 with f (nine), never the
reverse, so the mapping is supported by the data rather than assumed.

## Derived columns in pasztor_2022_clouded_apollo_body_size.csv

This is the only bundled example whose analysis columns are derived rather than archived. The three archived files
(`mass_data_2014_2020`, `thorax_data_2014_2020`, `wing_data_2014_2020`) hold measurement dates, not ages, so the
variables the paper models had to be rebuilt from them. Each follows the definition given in the paper's Section 2.3:

| Column | How it is derived |
|---|---|
| `age_days` | Days elapsed between a measurement and that individual's first capture. The paper uses this as a minimum estimate of true age. |
| `first_capture` | The day of that year's flight period on which the individual was first caught, counted from the flight-period start dates in the paper's Table 1 (17 Apr 2014, 26 Apr 2015, 22 Apr 2016, 25 Apr 2017, 29 Apr 2018, 21 Apr 2019, 21 Apr 2020). |
| `mean_age` | The individual's mean `age_days` across its measurements. |
| `mean_age_sq` | The mean of `age_days` SQUARED across an individual's measurements - the paper's "mean (age2)". Note this is the mean of the squares, not the square of the mean; the two differ by the within-individual variance of age, and for these data the difference is immaterial (median 4.1 day-squared, and the two forms differ by 0.3 AIC when fitted). |
| `mean_first_capture` | The annual mean of `first_capture`, which the paper uses as a year-level covariate correlated with flight-period length. |
| `wing_length` | Mean of the two forewing measurements (`wfl`, `wfr`); one value per individual, as wing length does not change with age. |
| `thorax_width` | Mean of the two caliper measurements per occasion (`tw1`, `tw2`). |
| `log_body_mass` | Natural log of `body_mass`, as the paper models it. |

Reconstruction checks against the paper: 1,190 individuals with body mass (paper 1,191); 70.2% measured at least
twice (paper 69.35%); 1,313 individuals with thorax width (paper 1,312) and 57.1% repeatedly (paper 56.86%);
once-measured butterflies averaged 0.186 g against 0.201 g for repeatedly measured ones (paper 0.187 and 0.205).
Fitting the paper's best-supported body-mass model reproduces every coefficient to within about one published
standard error, wing length included.


## Derived identifier: sanghvi_2022_beetle_female_fecundity.csv (disappR 0.20.0)
Some IDs in this file contain "?" where a character was lost when the file was re-encoded, so different beetles
share an ID: 15 IDs each covered more than one beetle (for example "B?15" holds one beetle from family Bpi on
treatment AH with lifespan 6, and one from family Btr on treatment AA with lifespan 12). The added column
`individual` joins Block, Family and ID, which identifies every beetle uniquely: 637 individuals, with no
conflicting lifespans or treatments and no two records at the same age. No original value was changed.
